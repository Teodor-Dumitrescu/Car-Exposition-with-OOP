Simulation of a Car Exposition using OOP concepts.
This is the third project for my Object Oriented Programming course, written in C++.
It is a simulation of a car exposition, which displays multiple types of cars, some of which can be bought
at the exposition. It introduced me to more advanced OOP concepts like template classes/functions, run time polymorphism
and virtual functions.
